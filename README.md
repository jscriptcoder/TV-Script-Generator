# TV Script Generator using RNN architecture

In this project, I be generating my own [Seinfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/) TV scripts using RNNs (LSTM/GRU), using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new "fake" TV script based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
