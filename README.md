# TV Script Generator using RNN architecture

See [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jscriptcoder/TV-Script-Generator/blob/master/tv_script_generation.ipynb) for details about this project and algorithms.

In this project, I'll be generating my own [Seinfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/) TV scripts using RNNs (LSTM/GRU), using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new "fake" TV script based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
